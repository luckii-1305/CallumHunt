<h1> Callum Hunt </h1>
          
<p>Callum "Call" Hunt is the son of Alastair and Sarah Hunt. Part of a family of magicians, Call inherited his parent's propensity towards magic and is himself a mage. Call is the second Makar of his generation, along with his best friend, Aaron Stewart. 
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Callum was still just an infant when his mother, Sarah, and his uncle, Declan, died during the Cold Massacre at La Rinconada, Peru. While Declan died protecting Call and Sarah, the Enemy of Death put his soul into Call's body, essentially killing the child. Sarah realized this and dropped him, causing his left leg to be permanently maimed. Without enough energy and will to kill Call/Constantine herself, Sarah carved the words "KILL THE CHILD" into the walls of the ice cavern as a message for whomever may see it.
<br>

<br>
Call was since raised by his father, Alastair, in North Carolina. Call grew up angry and stubborn, notorious in their town as a cranky, troublesome, and annoying boy who sent people running with his sarcastic remarks.
<br>

<br>        
Call's left leg, despite surgeries and physical therapy done to attempt to correct it, was left broken and Call walking with a sliding limp. The leg hurt often, more so as he grew, and he hated it when people comment on his limp. Call liked to skateboard and was often seen lurking around the comic book store, the arcade, and the video game store.
<br>

<br>       
Exempted from gym class and discouraged by school officials from any form of strenuous physical activity, Call yearned to play and was filled with restless energy. Aside from that, Call was often bullied because of his condition, though he always managed to turn them away.
<br>

<br>        
Once though, Call unwittingly provoked a group of kids into beating him up. It was at that moment when Call caused a small earthquake in the playground of their school. The ground cracked open and the bullies ran off. It was through this incident that Call's inclination towards magic was first made known to him. While Call was pleased when he found out, Alastair explained to him that magic was dangerous, that while his family was one of mages, it was a battle between magicians that killed his mother, Sarah. Alastair had since then conditioned Call's mind to fear magic and suppress it so he wouldn't be taken to the Magisterium.</p>
